*****COMPULSORY*****
--------------------
+ Used the function "System.out.println()"
+ Defining an array of string using "String[]"
+ Just copied that line of code in mine
+ For binary added "0b" in front, also for hexadecimal "0x" in front
+ Did a while that keeps working until sum is <10
+ Again the function from first point

------------------
*****HOMEWORK*****
------------------
+ Using "try...catch" to find out that it is integer
+ Used a simple way of displaying it, but using (row+column)%(n+1)+1
+ For each line I just did the string object, initialized it by first number, then added one by one the others from the same line
+ Used the function "System.nanoTime() twice, once before starting the program, one after, then substracting end-start
+ Still trying to figure it out why i get errors =)

*****BONUS*****
---------------
+ We know a cycle graph has degree 2, for every vertex ; then calculated the powers one by one -> I found a more optimised one by using a recursive way, using 4 variables: 2 for previous matrix, 2 for current one, diagonal & other elements (it is explained even in the program)
+ From the principal diagonal+1 i see the 0 positions and make them 1, also the mirrored one; when elements = k then going to next line and verifying the elements that are 1 until principal diagonal then doing the previous step again until the matrix is done
