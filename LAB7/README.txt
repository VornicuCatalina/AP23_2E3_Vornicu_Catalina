*****COMPULSORY*****
--------------------
+ I used the slides, for implementing the model of the classes

+ For moving randomly, I used the property Math.rand() * sizeOfTheMap twice, once for the row, and once for the column.
    The robot has an attribute called name for the name.
    I display more messages : for checking if the program works properly: "It is empty" - has no tokens ; "This cell has been visited before" - in the visited matrix, another bot already went there ; "<robotName> <msg>" - when it is the first time visiting it
    For the extracting, I wrote a function that does this
    Whenever it reaches a cell that is empty -> the thread is stopped

+ I simulated that by using "new Thread(robot).start();" -> working as it should do
